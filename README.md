# Car-Hub Website

This project is a Car-Hub Website, allowing users to filter and search for rental cars. It is built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Headless UI, and other technologies.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
Then
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Create from Scracth
Here are the steps to create Next.js dependencies:

1. Create a new project directory and navigate into it.
2. Initialize a new Node.js project using the following command
   
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest ./
```
3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
